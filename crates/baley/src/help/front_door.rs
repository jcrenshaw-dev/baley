/// What a session is told when it follows the help command.
pub const TEXT: &str = r#"Baley help lists the commands Baley offers and says what each one does.

With no command name, call `baley_query` once with `{"operation":"help"}`. Present every cluster in the order given, and under it each command with its name and description, whether it is available, and the build that owns it. Say plainly that a command that is not available cannot be used until its owning build.

With a command name, call `baley_query` with `{"operation":"help","name":"<command name>"}`. One optional leading slash and one optional `bal-` prefix select the same command: debug, bal-debug and /bal-debug are one command. Present that single row. When no row matches, show the closest names in the order given. Do not invent a command, and do not treat a close name as an exact match.

When an answer carries a `next` that is not null, call again with the same arguments and `part` set to that value, until `next` is null. Join the `body` values in order.

Read nothing else, search nothing and write nothing. Help reads only what Baley has compiled.

Send `bal-help`, the identity of this instruction, as `instruction` when you call the `baley_apply` operation `capture`, `project-start`, `story-refine`, `work-order-fail` or `work-order-retry` while following it. Send it on no other `baley_apply` operation, since their shapes refuse it. Never send it on a `baley_query` call.
