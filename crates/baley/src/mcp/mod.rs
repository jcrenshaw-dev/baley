//! The per-session server: what the session is, which client is calling, which
//! operations exist and in what order a call's faults are answered, then the
//! queue, the worker and the transports that carry the calls. The judging is
//! pure and tested with supplied values. The stdio, the worker thread and the
//! store are reached only by the gathering in `serve`, `transport`, `worker`,
//! `prepare`, `capture`, `document`, `scope`, `work_order`, `questions` and
//! `refine`.
