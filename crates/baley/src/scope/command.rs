//! The owner's scope commands (design 0004 sections 5 and 6, D-20): `baley
//! scope approve <digest>` approves the newest draft of a start or a change
//! as the owner, the only way scope is approved (D-24); `baley phase
//! reorder|withdraw`, `baley story reassign|drop` and `baley backlog reorder`
//! submit the id-only changes as drafts the owner then approves; and `baley
//! scope preview|show`, `baley phase show`, `baley backlog show` and `baley
//! story show` print what the ledger holds through the same reads as
//! `document`, recording nothing. Declarations, edits and `project describe`
//! come only from a session, since an agent drafts their text. `baley story
//! truths approve <digest>` is `refine::command`'s, which approves a story's
//! truth draft as `scope approve` approves a scope draft.
//!
//! Gathering finds the project and opens the ledger; judging, the arguments,

//! printed, is done by the pure functions below. Every text from the ledger
//! is printed as `escape_debug` writes it, quotes left plain, so a recorded
