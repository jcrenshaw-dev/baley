//! `story-refine`, `story-questions-submit` and `context-submit` on
//! `baley_apply`: a session asks for the analyzer's next order for one
//! story, submits the questions the analyzer returned as the story's set,
//! and submits the truths it drafted as a draft the owner approves at the
//! terminal (design 0005 `story refine`, `story questions submit` and
//! `story truths submit`, PLN-R2 to PLN-R6, D-06, D-07, D-08, D-09, D-19).
//! No operation here approves anything (ADR 0044). `context-intake` on
//! `baley_query` reads a story's refinement by its id, as the `document`
//! kind `refinement` does, recording nothing and issuing no order (D-10).
//!
//! Each call's arguments are judged before anything is prepared. The write
//! is then prepared with the call's check as its own check, so every refusal
//! comes before checkout admission and the policy step and records nothing,
//! and the order or the set is recorded through the `refine` library
//! functions.
