# Architecture decision records

Each file records one architectural decision: its context, the options weighed, the choice and its consequences. The format is [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/), after Michael Nygard. How records are written, reviewed and superseded is described in [the design process](../design/README.md).

Start a new record from [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md) with the next free four-digit number, skipping any number the index reserves. A reservation holds a number for a decision whose record is not written yet. Its row gains its link when its record lands.
