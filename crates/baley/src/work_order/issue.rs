//! The recording of one issued order (design 0001 Streams and Payloads,

//! on its subject's stream, in one domain transaction under the command its
//! caller prepared.
//!
//! The caller judges everything first and supplies what its judgement read:
//! the facts that must still be absent, the stream versions it saw and the
//! view documents it read. The decision declares all three, so an order
//! recorded, a start approved, a stream moved or a read document changed
//! since makes the store refuse the command as stale with nothing recorded.
