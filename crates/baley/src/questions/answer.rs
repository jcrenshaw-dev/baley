//! The recording of one answer call (design 0005 `questions answer`,
//! PLN-R24 to PLN-R26, HST-R9): a check that judges the call against its
//! set as read, recording nothing, and a recording that writes every
//! answer and deferral of the call in one domain transaction under the
//! command its caller built. `questions-answer` over MCP and
//! `baley questions answer` at the terminal both call these two functions
//! (ADR 0044), so the two surfaces judge and record a call the same way and
//! differ only in the command's actor and caller.
//!
//! The recording observes the set's document at the check's read, so a set
//! that moved since makes the store refuse the command as stale with
//! nothing recorded.
