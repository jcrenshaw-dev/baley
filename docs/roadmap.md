# Roadmap

This file is the order of work from now to Baley's first public release: nine builds, then the release design, a live acceptance run on Claude Code, and publishing. Status is Build 2 complete, Build 3 T1 to T17 merged (T17 is [#262](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/pull/262)) with [#24](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/24) open for what T17 left open, Build 4 T1 merged ([#268](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/pull/268)), Build 4 T2 merged ([#271](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/pull/271)), Build 4 T3 merged ([#276](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/pull/276)), Build 4 T4 merged ([#282](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/pull/282)), and Build 4 T5 in progress on this branch, based on main `01d29c02`, dated 2026-10-21, taken from the GitHub issues, milestones and pull requests of jcrenshaw-dev/baley and from the [design documents](design/) and [decision records](adr/). No issue, milestone or design document gives a date, so this file shows order only. The plan re-check design [#134](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/134) is recorded as landed on 2026-10-06 in [ADR 0037](adr/0037-plan-recheck-scope.md); its implementation belongs to Builds 4 and 5. The integration check design [#229](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/229) is recorded as landed on 2026-10-08 in [ADR 0042](adr/0042-mocked-boundary-integration-checks.md); its implementation belongs to Builds 4 and 5. The repository upkeep design [#47](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/47) is recorded as landed on 2026-10-06 in [0015](design/0015-repository-upkeep-and-build-gate.md); its remaining implementation belongs to #54, while UPK-R2 is implemented by [Build 3 delivery tasks T14 to T17](#build-3-hosts) ([#24](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/24)). The delivery and credential designs are recorded as landed on 2026-10-06 in [ADR 0038](adr/0038-installer-and-opt-in-updates.md) and [ADR 0039](adr/0039-session-owned-provider-credentials.md). Build 3 T17 is merged. Its installed run is recorded in `spikes/host-matrix` (`install-live-2026-10-11-run1.md` and a repeat of the install rerun, `install-live-2026-10-11-run2.md`), and what the run left open is listed in the Build 3 table and notes below, so Build 3 is not complete. Build 4 ([#25](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/25)) T2 removed the built key reader, `baley exec --key` and the HTTPS model lister ([#271](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/pull/271)). Each build pull request updates this roadmap.

## The path to the first release

Builds 1 to 9 run in order, and on GitHub each build issue is blocked by the one before it. All nine are in the milestone Evidence. The release design ([#14](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/14)) waits on all nine builds and on every other open issue except the Build 3 issues [#190](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/190), [#203](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/203), [#214](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/214), [#219](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/219), [#220](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/220), [#221](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/221), [#227](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/227), [#235](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/235), [#238](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/238) to [#249](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/249), [#251](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/251), [#252](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/252) and [#254](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/254) to [#256](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/256), which GitHub does not link to it.

[#22](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/22) · milestone Evidence · design [0001 evidence ledger](design/0001-evidence-ledger.md) · done

The evidence ledger store: a storage port with a SQLite adapter behind it, one conformance suite every adapter must pass, the hash chain, and forge anchors pushed with git. The owner's command line runs verify, doctor, export, purge, scrub, rebuild, anchor and acknowledge-restore, and `baley-bench` measures the real adapter. Nothing in the lifecycle uses the ledger yet.

## Build 2: Identity, settings and keys

[#23](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/23) · milestone Evidence · done

Baley finds its per-user ledger safely, and `baley init` ties a repository to a project through a committed `baley.toml`. Baley keeps its files in its own folder under a crenshawdev vendor folder: the global settings file `config.toml` and the keys file `keys.env` in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/crenshawdev/baley` and the ledger in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/crenshawdev/baley` on Linux (an empty or relative XDG variable counts as unset), all three in `~/Library/Application Support/crenshawdev/baley` on macOS, and all three in `BALEY_HOME` when it is set ([ADR 0027](adr/0027-vendor-folders-and-plain-keys.md)). The ledger's home is not supported on a network share, and Baley does not check for one. Baley reads the two TOML settings files ([ADR 0015](adr/0015-settings-in-toml.md)) and resolves routes against a model catalog it refreshes by calling each provider's model-list endpoint with `reqwest` ([ADR 0028](adr/0028-one-http-stack.md)). Provider keys are plain `NAME=value` lines in `keys.env`, which the owner edits by hand and Baley only reads, refusing it with `keys-file-exposed` when group or others can read it or another user owns it, and with `keys-file-invalid` when a line is invalid, a value is empty or a name appears twice, and with `keys-file-unreadable` when it is not a regular file or cannot be read. There is no encryption, no master key and no OS secret store. Keys reach a command only through `baley exec --key`; detection also reads them for provider model-list requests. Key values never enter events, views or exports. All of it runs from the command line, on Linux and macOS. This describes the completed build. [ADR 0039](adr/0039-session-owned-provider-credentials.md) replaces its credential and fetching design: Build 4 T2 removed the built reader, `baley exec --key` and the HTTPS lister ([#271](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/pull/271)).

## Build 3: Hosts

[#24](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/24) · milestone Evidence · in progress

Claude Code is the only host Baley supports in this release, and Build 3 removes Codex support. Each Claude Code session starts its own Baley MCP server over stdio, and the session's subagents reach it through the session's connection. There is no launcher, no HTTP listener and no background service, and every worker in this release is a subagent of its session. The server takes its project from `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, records its working directory beside it, and creates a session id that every call carries, with the host's own session id beside it when one is set. Ledger events record which caller wrote them. Each project call is prepared from the session's `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` in the order the command line uses: a read appends nothing, and a write runs checkout admission and the host's policy step before its command. T8's `capture` and `document` are the first operations to use it. Another host can connect and list the tools, but every tool call it makes is refused with Claude Code named as the supported host. Sessions share the ledger through the store: every write takes the writer queue and decides inside its transaction ([ADR 0012](adr/0012-optimistic-concurrency.md)), and the build's acceptance includes two live Claude Code sessions writing one project at once, with the record checked afterwards. Agents can neither read nor write Baley's home or its config folder (`config.toml`). Claude Code's sandbox, its file permission rules and Baley's guard hook carry that together, and `baley doctor` reports what an agent can reach. The designed credential boundary keeps keys in the owner's environment ([ADR 0039](adr/0039-session-owned-provider-credentials.md)), which those folder denials do not protect. The compiled instructions are served ([ADR 0009](adr/0009-served-instructions.md)): T7 serves help, the operation schemas and the compiled instructions by identity in parts, and T8, which builds `document`, attaches the instruction identity a session sends on `capture` to the caller it records, with the version and hash taken from the registry. The build renders the stub content that `baley install` writes, and it opens with warnings that say what a restore cannot undo. [ADR 0038](adr/0038-installer-and-opt-in-updates.md) specifies one installer command into `~/.local/bin`, with `baley install` writing every artifact at the stable path, no npm or plugin, and default setup with the interview available later. T14's development `install.sh` places the binary behind `~/.local/bin/baley` and ends by running `baley install` through that path. T15's `baley install` writes Claude Code's wiring: the user-scope MCP registration, made through `claude mcp add-json`, the pre-tool hook, the sandbox and file-tool denials merged into the user settings file, and the skill stubs. Updates are off by default and opt-in. At startup, `baley serve` reads `updates.auto` once and starts the detached check without waiting when it is on. The check claims at most one check per UTC day per installation, uses SHA-256 verification against an unsigned manifest, and stages a newer version beside the old ones. The guard never checks for updates. Running servers keep their version; the next hook call follows the stable path to the new binary. T14 keeps the newer hook compatible with an older server and ledger state, and T17 qualified that combination and the live install and update paths on Linux, with the results and open items in the Build 3 notes. Manual `baley update` is built and can run even on a day already claimed. T14 and T17 use unsigned development artifacts only. Both delivery paths have `verify_download` between download and staging. The release design #14 owns the signature format, trust root and both verifiers and must fill and qualify that seam before any release. Captures are recorded.

| T12 | Live Claude qualification and concurrent sessions. Run on 2026-10-08 against Claude Code 2.1.294 in three runs kept in `spikes/host-matrix`: the first sheet is `claude-live-2026-10-08-run1.md`, the rerun after the fixes for issues #231 and #232 is `claude-live-2026-10-08-run2.md`, and the final run, against commit `7c8ca4c3` after changes to the procedure, is `claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md`. The two defects the first run showed are `claude-live-2026-10-08-run1.md#exit.session-a` and `claude-live-2026-10-08-run1.md#hand.parts.document-main`, and the rerun passes both (`claude-live-2026-10-08-run2.md#exit.session-a`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run2.md#hand.parts.document-main`). No barrier failed: the Bash, Read, Write and Edit rows for the home and the config folder pass (`claude-live-2026-10-08-run1.md#bar.home.bash-read`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run1.md#bar.home.bash-write`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run1.md#bar.home.read-tool`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run1.md#bar.home.write-tool`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run1.md#bar.home.edit-tool`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run1.md#bar.config.bash-read`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run1.md#bar.config.bash-write`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run1.md#bar.config.read-tool`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run1.md#bar.config.write-tool`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run1.md#bar.config.edit-tool`). The final run found no defect. It passes Grep and Glob over each folder and over its parent, in a session launched with `--allowedTools Grep,Glob` because Claude Code 2.1.294 leaves both tools out of its default tool list, and the guard refused every call (`claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#bar.home.grep-folder`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#bar.home.grep-parent`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#bar.home.glob-folder`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#bar.home.glob-parent`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#bar.config.grep-folder`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#bar.config.grep-parent`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#bar.config.glob-folder`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#bar.config.glob-parent`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#ctl.grep-parent-guard`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#ctl.glob-parent-guard`). It also passes the hook on Grep, Glob, Write, Edit and NotebookEdit (`claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#ctl.hook.grep`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#ctl.hook.glob`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#ctl.hook.write`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#ctl.hook.edit`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#ctl.hook.notebookedit`), the user-scope registration in an isolated configuration, whose three tools were callable without a tool search in the main session and a subagent (`claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#id.user-scope.startup`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#hand.tools.user-main`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#hand.tools.user-subagent`), and the skill from both placements (`claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#hand.skill-listed`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#hand.skill-run`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#hand.skill-project-listed`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#hand.skill-project-run`). Acceptance left open or unverified: keys and detection, because Build 4 T2 removed the key reader, the credential wrapper and the model lister the row would exercise ([#271](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/pull/271)) (`claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#hand.keys-detection`); the restore report, which failed on one step, since a repeated `acknowledge-restore` is a new request that exits 1 with "already acknowledged" and prints no purge warning, so whether a replayed acknowledgement carrying the warning is reachable from the command line is open (`claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#hand.restore-report`); the PowerShell reads, writes, hook and recorded ask, because `pwsh` was absent in every run (`claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#bar.home.ps-read`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#ctl.hook.powershell`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#ctl.powershell-ask`); the `.git/HEAD` fallback, since with git off `PATH` the guard asked about unreadable settings and never reached the fallback path (`claude-live-2026-10-08-run1.md#ctl.fallback-head`); a hook timeout, since no guard call reached 10,000 ms and the highest took 49 ms (`claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#ctl.timeout-not-denial`, `claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#ctl.latency`); a live redelivery, since no `tool_use_id` arrived twice (`claude-live-2026-10-08-run3.md#ctl.redelivery`); the burst of calls in flight at exit, since Claude Code held `/exit` until the turn ended and no call was inside the server (`claude-live-2026-10-08-run2.md#exit.burst`); the guard's own deny of a Write to a protected file, since the Edit deny rule refused that Write before the hook ran (`claude-live-2026-10-08-run1.md#ctl.write-baleytoml-denied`); the Edit rule's reach over NotebookEdit, which the read-first check refused first (`claude-live-2026-10-08-run1.md#bar.home.notebook-edit`); host-specific settings, since neither config file had a host section to list (`claude-live-2026-10-08-run1.md#hand.config-show`); and the arrival of served-answer parts after part 1, since only part 1 was read (`claude-live-2026-10-08-run2.md#hand.parts.document-main`) | [#236](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/pull/236) | Merged |

The run left open the live repeat of the older-server fix (#258), which passed at Build 4 T3's raise of the view set to 9 (`older-server-live-2026-10-15.md`), Grep and Glob on Baley's home and config folder and the installed hook in bypass-permissions mode in a live session, whether a running session finds a newly written stub and the Bash read of Baley's home folder (both rest on the session's answer), and #190 | [#262](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/pull/262) | Merged; released-artifact verification and its qualification belong to #14 |

## Build 4: Planning

[#25](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/25) · milestone Evidence · in progress

The owner starts a project, shapes the story backlog, and commits stories to phases under a task capacity. Each story carries versioned truths, and each truth has one check. The analyzer and the planner ask the owner only the decisions left to the owner, each with a recommended answer, in rounds ordered by what each question depends on, and every answer and deferral is recorded ([ADR 0030](adr/0030-question-rounds.md)). Each phase's plan is written, checked, reviewed and risk-scanned, and approval binds the plan's exact digest. Every configured reviewer runs, and a provider that cannot be called is replaced by the host's own subagent reviewer unless that reviewer already runs. The host session makes the outside calls from Baley's work order and checks each finding, and the owner rules on each one that survives ([ADR 0013](adr/0013-host-session-calls-outside-models.md), [ADR 0019](adr/0019-reviews-adjudicated-and-ruled.md)). The first workers are dispatched here, so routing is finished here. The first dispatch task supplies Claude Code's identity rung map and a dated per-model table of supported effort levels. For a level a model does not support, the dated table predicts the highest level the model supports at or below it, and a model without effort is not applicable. The route records the requested rung and the effective level apart. `RungMap` is unchanged, and the owner reviews the initial table in that task's pull request.

Build 4 owns `baley models import`, the provider-list fetch work order and `models-return`, and checks the current provider acknowledgement before issuing review or fetch work. These depend on Build 3 T16's provider choice and typed acknowledgement in the ledger. T16 added the setup reader and writer of `review.reviewers`; Build 4 adds the review consumer. Build 4 also implements tier selection: an explicit setting, then the owner's entry for the tier, otherwise the newest accepted catalog id tagged for it by `created` date, then hint order, with the catalog record extension in 0003. Build 4 T2 removed the built `keys.env` reader, the `baley exec --key` credential wrapper, the HTTPS model lister and the credential lookup, and switched `baley init` from detection to seeding ([#271](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/pull/271)). The pure catalog parsing, classification, tagging, diff and event code stays.

Build 4 implements PLN-R16's full and diff plan re-check inputs, the setting's first reader and validation, immutable material for each round, and the scope recorded in plan-check and plan-review events and views. Design 0005 leaves the way the checker's revision and a plan review's revision combine for one plan as an open question owned by Build 4.

Build 4 adds the check `level`, `unit` or `integration`, to the evidence map grammar and serves the planner the integration rules of 0005 section 10: an integration check where a truth's outcome depends on two or more of the project's own units working together, with only outside boundaries mocked, each behind an interface the project owns ([ADR 0042](adr/0042-mocked-boundary-integration-checks.md)).

Build 4 T5 issues the first work order. `project-start` on `baley_apply` needs the project already in the ledger, and otherwise answers `project-not-in-ledger` naming `baley init`. It names a missing global settings file, or a project file that sets nothing beyond `[project]`, with `baley config interview` instead of running it, and it takes the brief as text the session read, refusing a blank brief `brief-blank` and one over 65,536 bytes `brief-too-large` with nothing recorded ([ADR 0045](adr/0045-project-start-from-a-session.md)). It records the start planner's work order as `work_order.issued` on the `roadmap` stream, with the brief as a `record` payload, the start planner's instruction and, when the checkout already holds code, the survey instruction, and a route record that keeps the requested rung, the model sent, the level Claude Code's dated effort table supports and the effective model and effort, recorded `unknown`, apart. A second start while that order is pending is refused `start-order-pending`, naming it. A session fails an order with `work-order-fail` and retries it with `work-order-retry`, which issues the next attempt one effort rung higher when escalation is on, held at `max`. A worker reads its order by id through `document`, the `route` query explains a route and records nothing, and `scope-submit` names the start order it answers. `baley install` places thirty agent stubs, one per role and effort rung, each with `model: inherit`, its rung's `effort` and the session's `baley` server by name, which the doctor compares and the guard protects ([ADR 0046](adr/0046-agent-stubs-per-role-and-rung.md)). The scope operations get five front doors, `bal-project`, `bal-scope`, `bal-phase`, `bal-story` and `bal-backlog`, with their instruction texts and help rows. The new `work_order` view raises the view set to 11.

## Build 5: Doing the work

[#26](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/26) · milestone Evidence · planned

Baley runs a phase's tasks and runs every test and check itself, judging by exit code ([ADR 0014](adr/0014-baley-runs-tests.md)). A task close is refused for any path outside the lease until the owner rules on it ([ADR 0018](adr/0018-lease-enforced-at-close.md)). Build 5 also supplies the active dispatch's lease to the guard's write decision, whose only lease input until then is "no active dispatch", and adds the out-of-lease deny (GRD-R11, EXE-R8). The verifier gets specs and run ids, never the executor's summary. Diff review and the completion risk scan gate each plan. A `fix` ruling opens a gap plan, and a finding is filed on GitHub only on the owner's command. A returning finding the owner dismissed before is brought back beside that dismissal, and the owner confirms or reverses it.

Build 5 constructs the full revised targets for diff and completion risk review re-checks, including the original reviewed changes and completed gap-plan fixes.

Build 5 serves the verifier the VER-R6 rule that rejects an integration check mocking one of the project's own units it claims to run together. Integration checks need no other execution change: they run red then green like any check, and the plan-close suite runs them as part of the project's test command ([ADR 0042](adr/0042-mocked-boundary-integration-checks.md)).

[#27](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/27) · milestone Evidence · planned

Milestones close and archive. A finished phase lands on GitHub one step at a time, and each push, pull request, merge, tag and cleanup needs its own owner authorization. Landing waits while a deferred review is unruled. The managed project's releases are proposed and confirmed. Undo and pause work. Anchors are pushed at every occasion the design names.

[#29](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/29) · milestone Evidence · planned

Ranked recall and exact "why" queries, then task, debug and spike on the ledger. Purge also removes search rows. Baley runs each debug reproduction itself: red before any hypothesis, and green at resolve over reproduction files byte-identical to the red run's. The owner can close an episode that never reproduced, with a reason. Debug gets the diagnosis review. A spike works outside the project and commits nothing.

[#30](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/30) · milestone Evidence · planned

Removes the old JSON record, the intent journal, participants, root binding, the Markdown renderers and parsers, and every `.planning` path. Builds `baley show` and record export to Markdown (EVD-R25), with the record-export spelling settled beside the standalone project export. Every owner command and every served instruction then reads the ledger. It also deletes the parked review engine (`crates/baley/src/inherited.rs` and the review code only it reaches), including its credentials reader (`crates/baley/src/review/provider/credentials.rs`), which still reads environment keys and `providers.env`. The real server's memory, start time and main operations are measured against design 0001's budgets. The timings are recorded as measurements, not test assertions.

## Release

### R1. Release design

[#14](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/14) · milestone Traders · not written · blocked

The tag gate (on main, CI green, version matches the crate). Static, reproducible Linux and macOS archives, refused if a checksum differs from the committed pin. Signed artifacts and provenance attestations. Release notes and whether a CHANGELOG starts. How releases relate to forge anchors and tag rules. This work owns the signed checksum manifest's signature format and trust root, both verifier implementations (the installer's available before Baley exists and the updater's), and their qualification. It fills T14's named `verify_download` seam between download and staging in both delivery paths. T14 and T17 will have built and qualified delivery with unsigned development artifacts only; no release exists before #14 completes verification. Installation follows [ADR 0038](adr/0038-installer-and-opt-in-updates.md): one installer command, binary-written wiring at the stable path, and opt-in verified updates for new server sessions, with the hook taking the new stable-path version at its next call. Provider access follows [ADR 0039](adr/0039-session-owned-provider-credentials.md), with no Baley key file or provider call. #14 must name any new signature-verification dependency; none is selected yet. It also picks the first version number.

Blocked by Builds 1 to 9 and by every issue in [Other open issues](#other-open-issues) except the Build 3 issues #190, #203, #214, #219, #220, #221, #227, #235, #238 to #249, #251, #252 and #254 to #256.

### R2. Live acceptance run on Claude Code

Planned. One throwaway Rust project on Claude Code, with its own private GitHub repository, taken through the whole loop from starting the project to a landed change. Anything that breaks is fixed as a bug with its own unit test. No end-to-end tests are added to the suite. A written list records what is knowingly left untested. The host matrix (EVD-R24) and the server measurements are re-run. The run is defined in #14, which leaves open whether it gates every release or only the first.

### R3. Publish and install

Planned. Publish Baley and install it on a machine for Claude Code. Milestone Traders. It has no issue of its own.

## Other open issues

Every issue here except the Build 3 issues blocks the release design #14. GitHub links none of the twenty-five Build 3 issues to #14. "Carried by" means that build does the fix.

|---|---|---|---|
| [#190](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/190) | `baley serve` drops calls it already read when input closes in the same burst | Evidence | T17 owns it: it runs the installed server live and fixes a confirmed defect in its own bug pull request. The 2026-10-11 installed run ended Claude Code's process with SIGTERM on its first `baley_apply` call: the one call sent was recorded exactly once (`install-live-2026-10-11-run1.md#exit.r1.answered`) and Claude Code saw the connection close before the answer arrived (`install-live-2026-10-11-run1.md#exit.condition`). That capture was recorded 1.4 ms before the signal, so under the rule corrected after the run no call is shown open inside the server, and the server's standard error did not reach the debug log, so no drain line could be seen (`install-live-2026-10-11-run1.md#exit.r1.stderr`). No dropped call was confirmed and no bug pull request was filed, so the in-flight check stays unverified. T12 merged in #236 without reproducing it. The 2026-10-08 runs confirmed no dropped call: every call the server read was answered and no drain line appeared, but no call was in flight inside the server at exit, so the check is unverified (`claude-live-2026-10-08-run2.md#exit.burst`).

## Not yet decided

What the records leave open or do not say.

- Builds 5 to 9 have no task breakdown. Each lists the design requirements it delivers, and all but Build 7 add a short list of settled points.
- There is no first version number. The release design #14 picks it.
- #44 was meant to land before Build 1 T10, which has merged. No order is given for bug #70.
- The board's Status field is set only on the build issues, #40 and #14.
- The release design #14 owns the signed checksum manifest's signature format, trust root and both verifiers, including qualification and any new dependency. Both `install.sh` and the updater now check SHA-256 against an unsigned manifest in `verify_download` before staging. T14 and T17 use unsigned development artifacts only, and nothing is released before #14 supplies and qualifies signature verification. Removing old versions also belongs to #14.
- Build 3 T14 now provides `baley update`, the opt-in detached check started by `baley serve`, the development `install.sh`, ledger update claims and events, and staged binaries at `~/.local/lib/crenshawdev/baley/versions/<version>/baley`. The placement map projects the versions folder for write-only protection, and the security proposal renders its denials. T14 leaves the view set at 7 and records update events only in `user`, adding no event type to the session's project. T17 qualified the live install script, the update path and a newer stable-path hook beside an older running server and its ledger state; its bullet below holds the results. T11 supplies the installed executable path to the protected-path projection.
- Build 3 T15 provides `baley install [--host claude-code]`, which writes Claude Code's wiring at the stable path. The Claude folder is `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` when it is set, else `~/.claude`, and one derivation of the stable path and the Claude folder serves install, the live guard and the doctor. Install writes the user settings file `<Claude folder>/settings.json` with the pre-tool hook, the `permissions.deny` rules and the sandbox block merged into the owner's settings, the skill stubs under `<Claude folder>/skills/`, and the user-scope MCP registration, which it has Claude Code write through `claude mcp add-json` and never writes itself. It replaces an artifact only when this binary's own render or `install.recorded` shows Baley wrote it. Otherwise it refuses `install-ownership-conflict` or `install-settings-conflict` before any write. Then it seeds the catalog and records `install.recorded` in `user`. The `install` view holds those records, so the view set rises from 7 to 8, and a binary built before T15 is read-only on `user` once a newer binary has brought its views to 8. The live guard now protects the placed stubs, the settings file, the registration file and the executable, and the versions folder as write-only. The doctor judges only what the install record shows, so a machine that never ran install still reports every artifact as not installed. An owner setting that weakens protection, a missing `bwrap` or `socat` on Linux, or nothing runnable at the stable path makes the install partial: the receipt names each gap with its fix and the command exits 1. Install writes nothing to `config.toml`. T16 builds on the settings file and the install record, as the next bullet says. T17's doctor reads the derived placements and the record in its installed-result checks, and the live install and Claude Code sessions on the written wiring ran in T17's qualification. Two cases are filed and not closed: a registration changed between install's check and its removal of the old entry ([#251](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/251)), and an older recorded hook removed while nothing runnable is at the stable path ([#252](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/252)).
- Build 3 T16 provides the owner's setup entry in `baley config interview`. After the thirteen settings questions the interview asks which outside review providers to use, `openai`, `deepseek` or `none`, and a blank answer keeps the stored choice. It shows design 0003's provider warning for each provider named and needs a typed `yes` to each, and it refuses `owner-identity-missing`, before the summary, when git has no `user.name`. The summary lists every file the confirmed writes can change or create. After the final `yes` four writes run in order, and a step with nothing to change is skipped. First, `providers.acknowledged` is recorded in the per-user project `user`, with the providers, the warning version and its SHA-256, git `user.name` and the time; a current acknowledgement is reused, and no view is added, so the view set stays at 8 and a binary built before T16 cannot write `user` once it holds the event. Second, each provider's API host, `api.openai.com` or `api.deepseek.com`, is added to `sandbox.network.allowedDomains` in Claude Code's settings file through the digest-checked replacement, with no install lock, no `install.recorded` and no `claude` command. Third, the global `review.reviewers` is written, and fourth, the settings answers go through the apply function `config set` uses. `review.reviewers` is now in the settings schema, default `["host"]`, with the interview as its setup reader and writer, and `config set` refuses it `list-not-settable`. A failure stops the run, prints its code and the writes already completed, and a rerun finishes only what is missing. `baley install` is unchanged: it records no acknowledgement and keeps every host the interview added. T16 hands Build 4 the recorded acknowledgement and `review.reviewers` for its review and fetch checks, and hands T17 the written settings and the install record, whose settings digest predates the file once the host step has run and is not drift. Enforcing the acknowledgement at issuance stays with Build 4.
- Build 3 T17 provides `baley doctor --host <name>`, default `claude-code`, which refuses an unknown host `unknown-host` with exit 2 before the ledger opens, and the delivery checks over what `baley install` and `baley config interview` wrote. The doctor reports a partial install and a held-back sandbox block as gaps, a hook install withheld, the placed hook and settings against the whole entries install renders and the record holds, each stub the record lists that the binary no longer ships as stale, an older stub Baley placed, the version the stable path links to, the writability of each folder install writes into, the provider hosts the settings allow, each provider's acknowledgement and the effective `updates.auto`, with a fix on every finding. It never compares the settings digest, so the interview's provider hosts are not drift, and it reads no running session's version. The installed run of 2026-10-11 used Claude Code 2.1.296 on Linux with unsigned development artifacts served from a throwaway branch of this repository. It showed a new session loading the server, the hook and the stubs, a running session reporting that it found a newly written stub at its next turn (that report and the new session's list of stubs rest on the session's answer, not on a file, the ledger or a receipt, and are unverified), protection of Baley's folders (the Bash read of the home folder rests on the session's quote of the `cat` and is unverified), the versions folder and the stable path, the manual and opt-in updates, the install rerun and a newer hook beside an older server (`spikes/host-matrix/install-live-2026-10-11-run1.md`). It found three defects: the older server could not write its own project once `user` was at a newer view set ([#258](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/258), fixed by [#260](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/pull/260)), install left a retired stub's file on disk ([#259](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/issues/259), fixed by [#261](https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/baley/pull/261)), and the doctor called Baley's own older stub foreign (commit `d95f482a`, in this task's code). A repeat of the install rerun after those fixes passes (`spikes/host-matrix/install-live-2026-10-11-run2.md`). Open after the run: the live repeat of #258's fix, owed at the next raise of the view set and run at Build 4 T3's raise to 9, where it passed (`spikes/host-matrix/older-server-live-2026-10-15.md`); Grep and Glob on Baley's home and config folder and the installed hook in bypass-permissions mode are unverified in a live session, as are whether a running session finds a newly written stub and the Bash read of the home folder, which rest on the session's answer; #190 is unverified; macOS was not run; signatures and release belong to #14. Build 3 stays open until T17 lands.
