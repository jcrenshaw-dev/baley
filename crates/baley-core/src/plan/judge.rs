//! The judgement of one submitted plan whole (design 0005 sections 3 and 6,
//! PLN-R11 to PLN-R13).
//!
//! A plan arrives as plain JSON and the phase's facts as plain values the
//! binary gathered from its views. The plan is judged in one fixed order,
//! the first fault answering, so one plan always gets one answer: (1) the
//! plan's own members, task by task within `tasks` and item by item within
//! `evidence_map`; (2) the `questions` member through the question set
//! judge; (3) each task file inside the lease; (4) no check field with a
//! code blank; (5) a committed story holding a truth; (6) every story the
//! plan serves committed to the phase; (7) each evidence item bound to its
//! own story's current truth; (8) each item id holding one definition
//! across the phase; (9) each link's value named by its truth; (10) every
//! truth the plan serves named by an item of the phase; (11) each such
//! truth holding a check; (12) each such truth a person must prove holding
//! an observation; (13) each such truth holding one check at most;
//! (14) the plan's tasks within the phase's capacity. The judge trusts the
//! facts and judges the plan. Nothing here records anything.
