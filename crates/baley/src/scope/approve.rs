//! The owner's approval of a start or change draft by its digest (design
//! 0004 section 5), in two steps that only `baley scope approve` calls: no
//! approval is served over MCP (ADR 0044).
//!
//! The first step reads and judges outside any transaction, before its
//! caller prepares the write, so a refusal records nothing at all: no
//! checkout admission, no policy step and no `command.completed`. A change
//! is judged twice there: against the newest draft of the same change, then
//! against accepted scope as it stands at approval (D-12). The second step
//! records the approval as the owner, confirming inside its transaction that
//! nothing the first step read has moved.
