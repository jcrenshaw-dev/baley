//! The compiled instruction registry: every instruction Baley serves to a
//! model, found by identity. The table is static data inside the binary, with
//! no disk loader and no override, so the text a model reads is the text that
//! was built and reviewed, and its version and hash can be recorded as evidence.
//!
//! An identity is a short name, the same one the help table gives the command,
//! and is never a path. A front door whose text is not built yet is registered
//! as unavailable with the build that owns it, so a caller learns where it
//! went instead of reading a stand-in.
