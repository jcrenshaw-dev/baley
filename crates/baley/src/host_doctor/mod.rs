//! The runtime doctor's host checks: what Claude Code's artifacts look like
//! on this machine, gathered as observations, judged as plain values and
//! reported as owner lines with an exit code.
//!
//! The work is three steps, each public and tested apart:
//! - an [`Observation`], what was gathered;
//! - [`judge`], which turns an observation into [`Findings`];
//! - [`Report::new`], which turns findings into lines and a code.
//!
//! [`gather`] is the one place that touches the filesystem: it reads each
//! placed file once and asks about the executable, and owns no rule. The
//! readers and their judgements are in [`placed`]. [`protection`] runs the
//! coverage judge once over the settings and hook documents the map
//! places, with the map's protected paths as the write-only list, and checks
//! that the guard runs before all nine tools of the hook's matcher.
//! [`prerequisites`] finds the programs the sandbox needs on `PATH` for the
//! target platform, and a missing one marks the sandbox unsupported for the
//! coverage judge.
//!
//! The placement map is decided by [`installed_placements`] from the paths
//! the guard and `baley install` share and from the latest install record:
//! only an artifact the record shows `baley install` wrote has a place.
//! Nothing here writes a file, the ledger or Claude Code's settings, and
//! nothing guesses where an artifact belongs: an artifact whose placement is
//! unknown is reported as not installed, and that alone never raises the exit
//! status. The one exception is the hook when a record exists: install
//! withheld it, which is a gap. [`observe`] reads the record beside the map,
//! and [`install_record`] judges whether that install finished, whether it
//! held the sandbox block back and which recorded stubs are stale. [`drift`]
//! judges whether the placed hook and settings still hold Baley's entries,
//! those install renders over the derived placements and those the record
//! holds. [`provider_hosts`] lists the review providers whose API host the
//! settings document allows. [`acknowledgement`] judges whether a current
//! acknowledgement covers each outside provider. The stable path is judged
//! by `update::installation::judge_active`, from the link alone. [`update_setting`]
//! judges the effective global `updates.auto` the way install records it.
