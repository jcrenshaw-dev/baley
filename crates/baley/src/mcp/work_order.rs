//! The work-order operations on `baley_apply` (design 0004 section 4,
//! design 0012). `project-start` records one `work_order.issued` for the
//! start planner on the `roadmap` stream, with the brief as a `record`
//! payload, after the arguments, the start check and preparation pass.
//! `work-order-fail` records one `work_order.failed` for a pending order a
//! session reports could not launch or returned without a valid result.
//! `work-order-retry` records the next attempt of a failed order as a new
//! `work_order.issued`, its route resolved again under the current policy. A
//! refusal records nothing. The `route` query on `baley_query` explains the
//! route a role or an order runs under, and records nothing at all.
