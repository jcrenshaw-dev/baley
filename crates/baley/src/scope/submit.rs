//! A start or change submission recorded as a draft (design 0004 section

//! scope does not change until the owner approves the draft by its digest.
//!
//! A start names the start planner's work order it answers, which is checked
//! before its write is prepared, and its events carry that order and the
//! order's instructions on their caller.
//!
//! A change is checked against accepted scope before its write is prepared,
//! so a change scope rules out records nothing at all (D-08), and its
//! transaction confirms the scope it was checked against has not moved.
